# Spring Cloud Docker Swarm

This provide:
* a `DiscoveryClient` that works with Docker Swarm Services
* an `EnvironmentPostProcessor` that would enable `docker` profile if it detects that the container is running in a Docker environment.

## Discovery Client

This is done through labels:

    spring.service.id: myservice

Service ID.  This is optional and will be computed from the service meta data.  However, the service metadata may not look too nice so this is provided.

    spring.service.enabled: false

Enable or disable service.  This defaults to false if service ID is not present.

    spring.service.port: 8080

The port of the registered service instance.  Defaults to `8080`

    spring.service.secure: false

Service instance uses HTTPS.  Defaults to `false`

It uses the following application properties

    docker.discovery.enabled: "true"
    
Enables functionality

    docker.discovery.networks: "mynetwork,othernetwork"
    
Specifies a comma separated list of networks to look for services that contain the service defintions.  If not specified it will use all the networks that the container has access to.

    docker.discovery.use-container-labels: "false"
    
Allows reading the labels from the container (as opposed to the service).  This is used for non-swarm configurations and is false by default.

## Testing notes

* Creating an insecure Docker connection for local testing

    docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 2375:2375 alpine/socat tcp-listen:2375,fork,reuseaddr unix-connect:/var/run/docker.sock 
    docker service create -d --name daemon --mount type=bind,src=/var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock -p 2375:2375 alpine/socat tcp-listen:2375,fork,reuseaddr unix-connect:/var/run/docker.sock
